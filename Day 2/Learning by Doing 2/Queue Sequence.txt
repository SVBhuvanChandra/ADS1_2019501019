Learning by Doing 2

Suppose that a client performs an intermixed sequence of (queue enqueue and dequeue operations. The enqueue operations put then integers 0 through 9 in order onto the queue; the dequeue operations print out the return value. Which of the following sequence(s) could not occur?

Enqueue operation for integers 0 through 9 
Queue = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
(a)	0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 - Possible
enqueue 0, dequeue, enqueue 1, dequeue, enqueue 2, dequeue, enqueue 3, dequeue, enqueue 4, dequeue, enqueue 5, dequeue, enqueue 6, dequeue, enqueue 7, dequeue, enqueue 8, dequeue, enqueue 9, dequeue
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]

(b)	4 6 8 7 5 3 2 9 0 1 - impossible
enqueue 0, enqueue 1, enqueue 2, enqueue 3, enqueue 4, dequeue
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4   it gives 0 instead of the 4 after dequeue operation, which makes the sequence could not occur.

(c)	2 5 6 7 4 8 9 3 1 0 - impossible
enqueue 0, enqueue 1, enqueue 2, dequeue
[0, 1, 2    it gives 0 instead of 2 after dequeue operation, which makes the sequence could not occur.

(d)	4 3 2 1 0 5 6 7 8 9 - impossible
enqueue 0, enqueue 1, enqueue 2, enqueue 3, enqueue 4, dequeue
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4   it gives 0 instead of 4 after dequeue operation, which makes the sequence could not occur.
